* Alphabetizing your CSS properties makes for easier reading
* Indenting by 2 spaces helps for readability
* When developing with CSS use classes as much as possible leave id(s) for Javascript
* Give everything a meaningful name
* By default all elements are set to position:static: Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow
* Single property items can be on the same line as enclosing bracket { } saves on whitespace while developing
* Whitespace is ignored, will not render in HTML file
* Every property should end with a semi colon
* Remember to compress your imagery: https://enviragallery.com/9-best-free-image-optimization-tools-for-image-compression/ no one want to wait and download a 1 MB image on a mobile device
* Fonts - web safe fonts will give you the most speed when someone is trying to view your site at an airport, museum, in a canyon - somewhere there is a slow connection, not everyone travels at the same speed
